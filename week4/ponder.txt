Your Name: Jason Halverson

1. Besides the obvious aspect of writing fewer lines of code, what is a benefit of having a method call the methods of an internal object, as opposed to doing the work itself? (E.g., Why is it beneficial for the get_subtotal method of the Order class to make use of methods from the Product class?)
This allows you to modify only one piece of code that then is utilized by other methods.

2. What is the most interesting thing you learned as a part of your work for this class this week?
Utilizing multiple python files as classes.

3. Describe one specific way that you helped someone else this week, or reached out for help.
Reached out to McKay Murphy to understand the expected code standards.

4. Are there any topics from this week that you still feel uneasy about, or would like to learn more about?
I feel I understand the material as much I have read and utilized the concepts.

5. How much time did you spend this week on each of the following:

Reading - 1
Checkpoint A - .5
