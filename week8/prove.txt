Your Name: Jason Halverson

1. In your own words, describe encapsulation.
Encapsulation is where you keep all the methods and variables in a class to itself. Another user / program should not have to know
the inner workings of your class, only that it can use public methods to access data and recievce data out.

2. What is a benefit of using a property instead of just having a setter function (e.g., set_angle(45))?
A property also lets you use it as a getter and a setter. It also is easier to understand what is happening with a specific idea.

3. What is the most interesting thing you learned as a part of your work for this class this week?
Using properties instead of getters and setters.

4. Describe one specific way that you helped someone else this week, or reached out for help.
I helped Eva, LSWelkls and Christopher understand properties.

5. Are there any topics from this week that you still feel uneasy about, or would like to learn more about?
