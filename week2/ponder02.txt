Your Name: Jason Halverson

1. Describe two benefits of using functions.
Repeatability, you do not need to re-code a solution over and over. 

The next benefit could be abstraction. You can focus on the task without knowing how another function works. 


2. If you were getting paid to write this week's "prove" assignment, and could spend another 100 hours on it, what would you do differently?


3. What is the most interesting thing you learned as a part of your work for this class this week?
This would have to be the Big O notation. I can see the benefit to having a mathmatical notation on if an algorithm is efficient or not.

4. Describe one specific way that you helped someone else this week, or reached out for help.
I found that f-strings don't work in the lab due to it only having python3.4 not 3.6. I notified my team mates via Slack.

5. Are there any topics from this week that you still feel uneasy about, or would like to learn more about?
Definetly Big O notation. I don't quite understand the logarithmic nuances of this yet.

6. How much time did you spend this week on each of the following:

Reading - 1.5hrs
Checkpoint A - .5hrs
Checkpoint B - .5hrs
Team Activity - 1 hrs
Data Structures Homework - 1 hrs
Prove Assignment - 2.5hrs

If you have other questions or comments for the instructor, please post them to Slack, either in the general channel if others can benefit, or as a direct message if the matter is more personal.
