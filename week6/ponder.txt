Your Name: Jason Halverson

1. Give a specific example of a time when you might want to override a method from a base class.
If the child class implements something different, like a velocity or point that the base class does not. If you want every flying object to come from
a different direction but the bullet class to come from a predefined direction.

2. Do you think IS-A or HAS-A is a better choice for the team activity (Circles and Points)? Why?
I think a composition (HAS-A) relationship is more appropriat as the circle has a point (center) and then it uses calculations to draw the circle. 
If this was a baser program and we were actually drawing the points then the circle could be considered a collection of points.

3. What is the most interesting thing you learned as a part of your work for this class this week?
Using the super() method to call the base class methods independently. 

4. Describe one specific way that you helped someone else this week, or reached out for help.
Eva had issues with her pong game, I helped her understand what classes were (an idea) and how objects are the concrete implementation of the classes.

5. Are there any topics from this week that you still feel uneasy about, or would like to learn more about?
Not really, always more to be learned about when to use OOP and refining relationships.

6. How much time did you spend this week on each of the following:

Reading - 2
Checkpoint A - 1
Checkpoint B - 1
Team Activity - 1
Data Structures Homework - 2
Prove Assignment - 6
