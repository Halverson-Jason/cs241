Your Name: Jason Halverson

1. Why is it important to avoid updating the position of the object in the on_draw function?
That would break the encapsulation of the objects for which you are updating the position. These objects should each have their own methods to update them selves. Also if another programmer
ever needed to modify the program they would not expect to have an update method in the draw method.

2. Besides game programming, can you think of any other applications that would likely use event-driven programming?
Toolbars, word processors, dynamic forms that processed logic when you typed into them. Mobile applications that dealt with touch and time.

3. What is the most interesting thing you learned as a part of your work for this class this week?
How easy it is to call libraries in python to deal with graphics. Also how one programmer can come up with the application logic and the other can fill in 
the details.

4. Describe one specific way that you helped someone else this week, or reached out for help.
I reached out to Brother Mellor about how to clean up the look of my code.

5. Are there any topics from this week that you still feel uneasy about, or would like to learn more about?
No I feel comfortable with all the material presented.

6. How much time did you spend this week on each of the following:

Reading - 1
Checkpoint A - .5
Checkpoint B - .5
Team Activity - 1
Data Structures Homework - 1
Prove Assignment - 3
