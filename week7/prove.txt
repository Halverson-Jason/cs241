1. Take a minute to search the Internet for an explanation of "polymorphism". You might especially consider sources such as StackOverflow and Wikipedia. 
After reading through some of these, in your own words, describe polymorphism AND why it's useful.

Polymorphism is where an object that inherits from a parent class is allowed to take a general idea and add onto that idea. This helps where a class can be 
the idea of an object and then another child class can implement its own methods and variables.

2. What is the benefit of making an empty abstract method in a base class?
It creates a contract that every inherited class must have that method but allow the different classes to implement different details.

3. What is the most interesting thing you learned as a part of your work for this class this week?
Mostly how to use polymorphism in python.

4. Describe one specific way that you helped someone else this week, or reached out for help.
I helped Rachael, Lisa, Berleyk, Christopher and Eva to understand Polymorphism in different senarios.
